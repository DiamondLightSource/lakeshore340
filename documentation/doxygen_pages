\section intro_sec Introduction
25 May 2007

The lakeshore340 support module provides an EPICS interface to the Lakeshore
340 Temperature Controller.

\subsection use_sec How to use this support module within an IOC application.

This support module makes use of the EPICS ASYN and Streams extensions.

<ol>
<li> Add a macro that points to the module in configure/RELEASE. Also the ASYN and Stream modules
need to be referenced, e.g. 
\verbatim
    ASYN=$(SUPPORT)/asyn/4-8
    STREAM=$(SUPPORT)/streamDevice/2-2
    LAKESHORE340 = /home/mp49/epics/support/lakeshore340
\endverbatim

<li> Add the module DBD file to the list of DBD. e.g. in src/Makefile\n
\verbatim

    BL16I-EA-IOC-01_DBD += lakeshore340.dbd

    #Note that the module requires the following DBD files in addition to base.dbd
    BL16I-EA-IOC-01_DBD += asyn.dbd
    BL16I-EA-IOC-01_DBD += drvVxi11.dbd
    BL16I-EA-IOC-01_DBD += stream.dbd
    BL16I-EA-IOC-01_DBD += drvAsynSerialPort.dbd
    BL16I-EA-IOC-01_DBD += drvAsynIPPort.dbd
\endverbatim

<li> Also in src/Makefile add the following libraries:
\verbatim
    BL16I-EA-IOC-01_LIBS += asyn
    BL16I-EA-IOC-01_LIBS += stream
\endverbatim

<li> In the Db/Makefile, the following is needed:
\verbatim
    USES_TEMPLATE += $(LAKESHORE340)/db/lakeshore340.template
\endverbatim

<li> In the IOC startup file, the following needs to be added:
\verbatim
    #Define protocol path
    epicsEnvSet("STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH", "$(INSTALL)/data/")
    
    #Records for Lakeshore 340.
    dbLoadRecords("db/lakeshore340.db")
    #General purpose Asyn Record.
    dbLoadRecords("db/asynRecord.db","P=BL16I-EA-LS340-01:,R=ASYN,PORT=L0,ADDR=12,OMAX=0,IMAX=200")
\endverbatim

The AsynRecord is optional but is useful for debugging and providing easy access to unsupported device functions. It would need to be set up for your own IOC.

Because this support module makes use of the ASYN support of the Agilent E5810A Ethernet->GPIB gateway, the following is also needed:
\verbatim
    #The following two commands are for the E5810
    E5810Reboot("172.23.116.185",0)

    # vxi11Configure parameters:
    # portName
    # host name
    # recover with IFC?
    # default timeout
    # vxiName
    # priority
    # disable auto-connect
    vxi11Configure("L0","172.23.116.185",0,0.0,"gpib0",0,0)
\endverbatim

Again the vxi11Configure() function has to be set up for your particular VXI11 device (in this case the Agilent E5810A).

</ol>
