\section intro_sec Introduction
25 May 2007

The lakeshore340 support module provides an EPICS interface to the Lakeshore
340 Temperature Controller.

\subsection use_sec How to use this support module within an IOC application.

This support module makes use of the EPICS ASYN and Streams extensions.

<ol>
<li> Add a macro that points to the module in configure/RELEASE. Also the ASYN and Stream modules
need to be referenced, e.g. 
\verbatim
    ASYN=		$(SUPPORT)/asyn/X-X
    STREAM=		$(SUPPORT)/streamDevice/X-X
    LAKESHORE340=	$(SUPPORT)/lakeshore340/X-X
\endverbatim
Note that the streamDevice module must be later than 2-2 (as this has a bug relating to GPIB devices).

<li> Add the module DBD file to the list of DBD. e.g. in src/Makefile\n
\verbatim

    BL16I-EA-IOC-01_DBD += lakeshore340.dbd

    #Note that the module requires the following DBD files in addition to base.dbd
    BL16I-EA-IOC-01_DBD += asyn.dbd
    BL16I-EA-IOC-01_DBD += drvVxi11.dbd
    BL16I-EA-IOC-01_DBD += stream.dbd
    BL16I-EA-IOC-01_DBD += drvAsynSerialPort.dbd
    BL16I-EA-IOC-01_DBD += drvAsynIPPort.dbd
\endverbatim

<li> Also in src/Makefile add the following libraries:
\verbatim
    BL16I-EA-IOC-01_LIBS += asyn
    BL16I-EA-IOC-01_LIBS += stream
\endverbatim

<li> In the Db/Makefile, the following is needed:
\verbatim
    DB += $(ASYN)/db/asynRecord.db    
    USES_TEMPLATE += $(LAKESHORE340)/db/lakeshore340.template
\endverbatim
Note that the asynRecord is optional, and needs to be configured correctly in the IOC startup file. However, it is useful to have loaded to be able to use unsupported commands (ie. commands not implemented in the lakeshore340 support module).

<li> In the IOC startup file, the following needs to be added:
\verbatim
    #Define protocol path
    epicsEnvSet("STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH", "$(LAKESHORE340)/data/")
    
    #General purpose Asyn Record.
    dbLoadRecords("db/asynRecord.db","P=BL16I-EA-LS340-01:,R=ASYN,PORT=L0,ADDR=12,OMAX=0,IMAX=200")
\endverbatim
If you are using the asyn record, then change the configuration parameters accordingly.

Because this support module makes use of the ASYN support of the Agilent E5810A Ethernet->GPIB gateway, the following is also needed:
\verbatim
    #The following two commands are for the E5810
    E5810Reboot("172.23.116.185",0)

    # vxi11Configure parameters:
    # portName
    # host name
    # recover with IFC?
    # default timeout
    # vxiName
    # priority
    # disable auto-connect
    vxi11Configure("L0","172.23.116.185",0,0.0,"gpib0",0,0)
\endverbatim
Again the vxi11Configure() function has to be set up for your particular VXI11 device (in this case the Agilent E5810A).

</ol>

/**
\page add_sec How to add functionality to the module

To add more functionality to this support module (by adding support for more Lakeshore 340 commands), 
the following files must be edited:

- lakeshore340App/protocol/lakeshore340.proto\n
  Add the streamDevice protocol functions in this file.

- lakeshore340App/Db/lakeshore340.template\n
  Add the corresponding record, which when processed will call the streamDevice function.
